# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about)!

### Personal Rules

These are entirely self-imposed, for my own challenge and enjoyment, and not
part of AoC itself.

1. Solve all events and puzzles in order, without skipping any.
2. Use a single _unique_ programming language to solve each event.
3. Use only the language's standard library, within reason*.
4. Include all official example inputs in the project as automated test cases.

\* _using third-party tools for things like testing or type checking is fine_

### Setup Notes

I'm currently using [`asdf`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to manage tool
versions. Use `asdf install` to install all required languages at the exact
versions I last tested with. See the event READMEs for setup steps specific to
individual events.
