# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/about)!

Event            | Language | Status
:--------------: | :------: | :----:
[**2015**](2015) | [Ruby]   | 🏁
[**2016**](2016) | [Elixir] | 🏁
 **2017**        |  TBD     | 💭

[Elixir]: https://elixir-lang.org/

### Personal Rules

These are entirely self-imposed, for my own challenge and enjoyment, and not
part of AoC itself.

1. Solve all events and puzzles in order, without skipping any.
2. Each event must use a single _unique_ programming language.
3. Solution code may only use the language's standard library.*
4. All official example inputs should be included in the project as automated
   test cases.

_\* using external libraries in non-solution code, like automated tests, is OK_

### Setup Notes

I'm currently using [`asdf`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to manage tool
versions. Use `asdf install` to install all required languages at the exact
versions I last tested with. See the event READMEs for setup steps specific to
individual events.
