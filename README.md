# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/events)!
Here are my goals for writing them:

1. Use a different language for each event
2. Use only the language's standard library
3. Keep code idiomatic, modular, and testable
4. Include a reasonable level of test coverage

Event        | Language | Progress
:----------: | :------: | :------:
[2015](2015) | Ruby     | 100%
2016         | `TBD`    | 0%
2017         | `TBD`    | 0%
2018         | `TBD`    | 0%
