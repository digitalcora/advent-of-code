# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/events)!
Here are my goals for writing them:

1. Use a different language for each event
2. Use only the language's standard library
3. Keep code idiomatic, modular, and testable
4. Include a reasonable level of test coverage

Event        | Language | Progress
:----------: | :------: | :------:
[2015](2015) | Ruby     | 100%
[2016](2016) | Elixir   | 0%
2017         | `TBD`    | 0%
2018         | `TBD`    | 0%

## Setup Notes

I'm currently using [`asdf`](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) to manage tool
versions. Use `asdf install` to install all required languages at the exact
versions I've last tested with. For setup notes on individual events, see the
event READMEs.
