### Retrospective

The Advent that started it all, and at this point, likely the only one where
I'll ever complete a majority of the puzzles the same year the event started!
Being part of an in-person workplace with many of my coworkers participating
definitely contributed to this.

At the time I was using and enjoying Ruby for both work and personal projects,
so it was the natural choice. By the time I finally completed the event several
years later, I was starting to pick up Elixir, so that was my choice for the
next one ‚Äî and the origin of my "different language for each event" rule.

Writing in 2023, four years from when I last worked on this event, it's hard to
recall any aspects that stood out. The difficulty curve felt well-crafted, and
Ruby's generous standard library meant most solutions (even for higher-level
puzzles) came in under 50 lines of code. This made me confident that "standard
library only" would be a good personal rule for future events.

I do remember [Day 22](days/22) being the most intimidating puzzle, which may
partly explain the 2-year gap before I completed it. Returning with a couple
additional years of programming experience, I couldn't remember exactly what
had made it so challenging.

Since [Ruby 3.0][r300] released long after I finished this event, and I have
limited interest in the language now, the code is untested on "modern" Ruby and
I don't plan on upgrading it to use newer features.
